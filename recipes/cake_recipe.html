        <h3> The Origins of Red Velvet Cake</h3>
            <p>Red velvet cake has a rather lengthy origin story. In fact,it dates all the way back to the Victorian era.
                Starting in the 1800s, cooks began adding cocoa powder to cake mix to soften the protein in the flour.
                Before this, cakes had a drier, more crumbly texture. 
                Adding cocoa powder resulted in a lighter, fluffier cake, eventually earning the name "velvet cake."

            <li> 1 teaspoon salt</li>
                
            <li> 1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
                
            <li>2 ½ cups sifted all-purpose flour</li> 
                
            <li>1 tablespoon distilled white vinegar</li> 
                
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons baking soda</li> 
            
        </ul>
        <h6>Steps:</h6>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two 9-inch round pans.</li>
            <li>Make the cake: Beat 1 1/2 cups sugar and shortening together 
                in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. 
                Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. 
                Combine red food coloring and cocoa to make a paste; add to creamed mixture.</li>
            <li>Mix buttermilk, salt, and 1 teaspoon vanilla together in a small bowl. Add flour,
                 alternating with buttermilk mixture, mixing just until incorporated. 
                Mix vinegar and baking soda together; gently fold into cake batter and pour into prepared pans.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 30 minutes.
                 Cool on a wire rack for 5 minutes. Run a table knife around the edges to loosen.
                 Invert carefully onto a serving plate or cooling rack. Let cool, about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Make the icing: Heat milk and flour in a saucepan over low heat, stirring constantly, until thick. 
                Set aside to cool completely.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, beat sugar, butter, and vanilla together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. 
                Add cooled flour mixture and beat until frosting is a good spreading consistency. 
                Frost cake layers when completely cool.</li>
        </ol>
